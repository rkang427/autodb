# Diagrams
We are using draw.io for developing our EER and IFD.

You can edit the file locally by downloading the appropriate drawio installer from https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/tag/v24.7.8

You may need to install "make" to run this.

Our EER and IFD are located in `Phase_1/`.
Open and edit it with drawio.
Once you've made your changes, run `make diagrams` to generage JPG and PDF versions of them.
Then commit them to a branch and make a PR to the main branch.

The JPG is best for being able to view the changes in github. The PDF is what we will eventually turn in.

Brew Installation:
 - `brew install --cask drawio`
 - `alias drawio="/Applications/draw.io.app/Contents/MacOS/draw.io"`
